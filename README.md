## Contract interface

The `AnchornetContract` tracks per-asset liquidity pools funded by registered
anchors. The off-chain indexer subscribes to the emitted events to mirror pool
state.

| Function | Auth | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `initialize(admin)` | once | Set the contract administrator |
| `admin()` | – | Read the current administrator |
| `set_admin(new_admin)` | admin | Transfer administration in a single step |

#### Anchor and asset list growth

`list_anchors(start, limit)`, `anchor_count()`, `list_assets(start, limit)`,
and `asset_count()` read from persistent `AnchorList` and `AssetList` entries
that are append-only history lists. `register_anchor` / `register_anchors`
append a newly seen anchor through `remember_anchor`, and the first liquidity
provision for an asset appends through `remember_asset`. `deregister_anchor`
only flips that anchor's active flag; it does not remove the address from
`AnchorList`, so pagination continues to scan the ever-seen list and skip
inactive anchors when returning active results.

Each new anchor or asset currently rewrites the whole vector entry, so the
write cost grows with the number of distinct anchors/assets ever observed.
Until the storage-scalability refactor in [#124](https://github.com/AnchorNet-Org/AnchorNet-Contracts/issues/124)
lands, integrators should treat hundreds of anchors/assets as a planning
threshold rather than assuming thousands will fit comfortably in one contract.
For larger deployments, benchmark realistic `register_anchors`, first-asset
`provide_liquidity`, and paginated list calls against the target Soroban
network budget, and prefer smaller onboarding batches so a single transaction
is not coupled to the full historical list size.
| `max_settlement_amount(asset)` | – | Read the maximum settlement amount configured for an asset |

### Admin & lifecycle

| Function | Auth | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `pause(caller)` / `unpause(caller)` | admin or operator | Halt or resume liquidity & settlement mutations |
| `set_operator(operator)` | admin | Appoint an operator that may pause/unpause but cannot change fees or admin |
| `clear_operator()` | admin | Revoke the operator role entirely |
| `operator()` | – | Read the currently appointed operator |
| `is_operator(address)` | – | Check whether an address is the currently appointed operator |
| `extend_instance_ttl(caller)` | admin or operator | Extend the contract instance/code TTL so it survives long inactivity |

> **Note:** `extend_instance_ttl` only refreshes the **instance** storage bucket. Persistent entries (e.g., `Anchor`, `Pool`, `Balance`, etc.) have independent TTLs managed by per‑key `extend` calls on read/write.

| `set_fee(bps)` | admin | Set the protocol fee in basis points (max 1000) |
| `fee()` / `quote_fee(asset, amount)` | – | Read the global fee rate / preview the effective fee for an asset |
| `max_fee_bps()` | – | Read the maximum fee `set_fee`/`set_asset_fee` will accept |
| `set_asset_fee(asset, bps)` | admin | Override the protocol fee for one asset, independent of the global rate |
| `clear_asset_fee(asset)` | admin | Remove an asset's fee override, reverting it to the global rate |
| `asset_fee(asset)` | – | Read the effective fee for an asset (its override, or the global rate) |
| `collect_fees(asset)` | admin | Collect accrued protocol fees for an asset |
| `fees_accrued(asset)` | – | Read uncollected fees for an asset |
| `total_fees_accrued()` | – | Read the sum of uncollected fees across every asset ever funded |
| `set_fee_waiver(anchor, waived)` | admin | Grant or revoke a fee waiver for a registered anchor |
| `is_fee_waived(anchor)` | – | Check whether an anchor is exempt from settlement fees |
| `list_fee_waived_anchors(start, limit)` | – | Page through currently registered anchors with an active fee waiver |
| `fee_waived_anchor_count()` | – | Read the number of currently registered anchors with an active fee waiver |
| `version()` | – | Read the contract interface version |

Fee calculations intentionally use floor division:
`floor(amount * bps / 10_000)`. As a result, tiny settlements can have a
zero fee even when the configured rate is nonzero. For example, at 1 bps,
amounts below 10,000 quote and accrue a fee of 0, while an amount of 10,000
produces a fee of 1. This rounding behavior is an accepted protocol tradeoff.

### Settlement

| Function | Auth | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `open_settlement(anchor, asset, amount)` | anchor | Reserve pool liquidity, returns a settlement id |
| `execute_settlement(id)` | admin | Finalize a settlement and accrue its fee |
| `cancel_settlement(id)` | anchor | Cancel and return reserved liquidity to the pool |
| `cancel_expired_settlement(id)` | – | Reclaim a timed-out pending settlement's liquidity to the pool |
| `set_settlement_expiry_ledgers(ledgers)` | admin | Set the ledger window after which a pending settlement may be reclaimed (0 disables) |
| `settlement_expiry_ledgers()` | – | Read the settlement expiry window in ledgers |
| `settlement_exists(id)` | – | Check whether a settlement exists |
| `is_settlement_pending(id)` | – | Check whether a settlement exists and its status is `Pending` |
| `is_settlement_expired(id)` | – | Check whether a pending settlement has passed the expiry window, without reclaiming it |
| `settlement(id)` | – | Read a settlement record |
| `settlement_count()` | – | Read the number of settlements |
| `list_settlements(start, limit)` | – | Page through settlements |
| `list_settlements_by_anchor(anchor, start, limit)` | – | Page through settlements opened by one anchor |
| `list_settlements_by_asset(asset, start, limit)` | – | Page through settlements in one asset |
| `list_settlements_by_anchor_and_asset(anchor, asset, start, limit)` | – | Page through settlements matching both anchor and asset |
| `list_settlements_by_status(status, start, limit)` | – | Page through settlements in a given lifecycle state |
| `settlement_count_by_status(status)` | – | Count every settlement in a given lifecycle state (no pagination) |
| `total_settled_amount(status)` | – | Sum settled `amount` across every settlement in a given lifecycle state |
| `contract_info()` | – | One-call snapshot of version, paused flag, fee, and anchor/asset/settlement counts |

`cancel_expired_settlement` requires no authorization: it only ever returns
liquidity to the shared pool it was reserved from, never to an external
party, so anyone (including an off-chain keeper) may call it once a pending
settlement has passed the configured expiry window.

`pause` and `unpause` take an explicit `caller` argument (Soroban contracts
have no implicit sender) that must be either the admin or the appointed
operator; the operator role is scoped to this one lifecycle switch and
carries no ability to change the fee, the admin, or any other admin-only
setting. Note that appointing the admin as its own operator is a supported
(if redundant) dual-role configuration.

#### Operator permission boundary

The table below lists **every gated entrypoint** and which guard function
it calls in [`src/lib.rs`](src/lib.rs), so integrators and delegates can
verify the boundary without reading individual doc comments.

**`require_admin_or_operator` — admin _or_ operator may call**

| Entrypoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `pause(caller)` | Halt liquidity & settlement mutations |
| `unpause(caller)` | Resume after a pause |
| `extend_instance_ttl(caller)` | Extend contract instance/code TTL |

**`require_admin` — admin only (operator excluded)**

| Entrypoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `set_admin(new_admin)` | Transfer administration (single-step) |
| `propose_admin(candidate)` | Initiate a two-step admin transfer |
| `set_operator(operator)` | Appoint or replace the operator |
| `register_anchor(anchor)` | Approve a new liquidity provider |
| `register_anchors(anchors)` | Batch-approve liquidity providers |
| `deregister_anchor(anchor)` | Remove an anchor from the approved set |
| `set_fee(bps)` | Set the global protocol fee |
| `set_asset_fee(asset, bps)` | Override the fee for one asset |
| `clear_asset_fee(asset)` | Remove an asset's fee override |
| `set_fee_waiver(anchor, waived)` | Grant or revoke a fee waiver |
| `collect_fees(asset)` | Collect accrued protocol fees |
| `set_min_liquidity(asset, floor)` | Set the minimum liquidity floor |
| `set_max_settlement_amount(asset, amount)` | Cap per-settlement reserve size |
| `set_settlement_expiry_ledgers(ledgers)` | Set the settlement expiry window |
| `execute_settlement(id)` | Finalize a pending settlement |

> **Note:** The three-entry `require_admin_or_operator` list and the
> fifteen-entry `require_admin` list are derived directly from the
> corresponding call sites in `src/lib.rs`. When a new entrypoint is added,
> check which guard it calls and update this table accordingly.

## Contract metadata

The compiled wasm embeds `Name` and `Description` entries (via
`contractmeta!`) so tooling that inspects the deployed contract can identify
it without an off-chain registry.
